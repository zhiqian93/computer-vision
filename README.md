    Using the examples of PyKinectBodyGame.py, we constructed:
        - the skeleton on depth images
        - detection of hand hygiene once wrist is close to the other wrist
    To do:
        - Further refine HH movements
        - Differentiate clinicians, patients and nurses
        - Record data
        - Purchase/Research Potential Dev Boards
        - Or perhaps buy an Intel Real Sense Kit
